Alternatively, I've also come up with small scripts to automate the process somewhat, with a few caveats:

[LIST]
[*] They rely on decently recent features, on every platform (i.e., Windows 10, a not terribly outdated macOS version, and a decently recent Linux distribution).
[*] They'll only behave properly with a *single* Kobo plugged to the computer. Running 'em with *no* Kobo plugged in is safe, running 'em with multiple Kobos may lead to unexpected behavior: it may be handled sanely, but it might not.
[*] On macOS, this doesn't protect you from some of its stupid [url=https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showpost.php?p=3724649&postcount=96]"Quality of Life"[/url] features. Of particular interest here, Safari and its tendency to do stupid things with ZIP archives. If you don't want to change your Safari settings, you'll have to fish out the original ZIP archive from your Trash.
[*] Most browsers will treat the Windows script as a text file, so you'll have to [i]Right Click[/i] > [i]Save Link As[/i] [COLOR="Grey"](or [i]Download Linked File[/i] in Safari)[/COLOR] on the link to download it.
[/LIST]

With that out of the way, here's what this is supposed to automate: figuring out where the Kobo is mounted, asking you to confirm what you want to install, and properly unpacking the right archive. This will also automatically prevent Nickel from scanning *nix hidden folders on FW 4.17+.

Note that, in addition to the packages in the first post, the scripts also handle [url=https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=274231]KFMon[/url]'s standalone install package, to quickly restore functionality after a FW update, for instance ;).

Onwards!

And that's it! For reference, here's how the script's output could look like:
