You'll find here links to so called [B]"one-click"[/B] install packages for both [url=https://github.com/koreader/koreader]KOReader[/url] & [url=https://github.com/baskerville/plato]Plato[/url].
This is primarily aimed at brand new users, with the goal of getting things to work in the most fool-proof manner possible, by simply unpacking a single ZIP archive in the root of your Kobo eReader over USB.
To make this possible, these packages rely on [url=https://github.com/NiLuJe/kfmon]KFMon[/url].

For existing users, if you're happy with your current setup, by all means, carry on! ;). If you're curious as to what this actually [I]does[/I] to original KOreader/Plato packages, the gory details are [url=https://github.com/NiLuJe/kfmon/blob/master/tools/one-click.py]all here[/url]!

Now that this is out of the way, on to the good stuff!

As mentioned earlier, the installation instructions are dead simple:
[LIST=1]
[*] Choose what you want to install: KOReader, Plato, or both, and download the appropriate ZIP from the listing below.
[*] Plug your Kobo eReader to your computer over USB.
[*] Directly extract the ZIP archive you've just downloaded to the [I]root[/I] directory of your device (i.e., not under [I]any[/I] subdirectory). [COLOR="DarkGrey"](That's the [B]"one click"[/B] bit ;p)[/COLOR]
   NOTE: Prefer the "Extract To" approach (and allow replacing existing content if it's asked of you) vs. manually copy/pasting or drag'n dropping bits of the ZIP content yourself, as preserving the integrity of the directory structure and its contents is of paramount importance!
[*] Eject & unplug your device. The Kobo software should then appear to be processing a book, before restarting to process an update.
   NOTE: If it [I]doesn't[/I] attempt to reboot, that's a sure thing something went wrong in the previous step (hint: see the NOTE).
[*] Once your device has finished rebooting, you should simply be able to tap on the KOReader or Plato icon in your Home or your Library to launch it!

[B]NOTE:[/B] Something that bears repeating from [url=https://github.com/NiLuJe/kfmon#things-to-watch-out-for]KFMon's FAQ[/url]: a FW update will [i]disable[/i] it, so you'll have to reinstall it after a FW update in order to be able to launch stuff again. You can either use these packages or the standalone [url=https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=274231]KFMon[/url] package.
